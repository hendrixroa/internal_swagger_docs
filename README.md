# Internal Swagger docs

Why the word `internal`? because this webpage is protected by aws cognito service, review the *env.sample* file to make sure you are setting the proper aws cognito credentials that will generate the login page like this: 

![login](./images/login.png "Login")

and page (swagger definition hosted):

![page](./images/page.png "Page")

## Replace swagger spec file

In the folder `src/spec` there is swagger spec sample, replace it by your own ðŸ˜‰.
